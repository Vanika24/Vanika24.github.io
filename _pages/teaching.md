Throughout my life, I have always been a minority. Growing up, I often felt excluded from society and overlooked. These feelings can have a detrimental effect on one's progress and potential for success, making it challenging to achieve a decent life. Unfortunately, my struggles began at an early age. When I was only seven years old, I became an orphan and was left homeless. In search of a better life, I climbed onto the back of a truck in Sihanoukville and headed to Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Without any family to take care of me, I had to fend for myself by picking and selling rubbish at the Stung Meanchey dumpsite - a massive, heaving mound of the capital's waste. My primary goal was merely to survive each day.

However, a ray of hope shone upon me when I was eight years old. I discovered the Centre for Children's Happiness home, which offered three meals a day and a clean bed to children who lived at the dumpsite. Finally, I had a chance to go to school and be seen and heard for the first time. It was a liberating feeling, and I was determined to make the most of this opportunity. As a result, I topped my class and was even able to skip ahead, reaching Grade 9 at the tender age of 13.

In 2008, I was blessed to receive a five-year scholarship to the [United World College of Southeast Asia](https://www.uwcsea.edu.sg/), an international school in Singapore known for its progressive approach and high academic standards. The scholarship was awarded to me after an exhaustive vetting process that included provincial exams in math, English, and Khmer, selection days, and multiple rounds of interviews. It was a turning point in my life, as I had the chance to live and learn alongside students from 101 different countries and backgrounds. This community taught me the true meaning of diversity, equity, and inclusion.

My journey did not end there, as I was awarded a fully-funded scholarship through the [Davis United World College Scholars Program](https://www.davisuwcscholars.org/scholars/2017/C/node/9537) to attend Colorado College for my undergraduate degree. Following that, I decided to pursue a PhD in Economics at Colorado State University. I am now a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Economics at [Lafayette College](https://economics.lafayette.edu/people/sayorn-chin/). None of this would have been possible without people who appreciate the value of diversity, equity, and inclusion.

I believe that messy lives can turn into beautiful messes, but the process requires help and the feeling of being included. I share this story to emphasize the importance of diversity and inclusion, especially in the classroom. As a teacher and mentor, I strive to incorporate these principles in my teaching pedagogy, making sure that all students feel comfortable participating in classroom discussions and activities. I understand that each individual student has unique talents and struggles, and I aim to foster an environment that promotes growth and learning for all. My teaching portfolio and a selection of my teaching materials are available upon request.
