I am a junior at [Lafayette College](https://www.lafayette.edu/) pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics and Economics with a minor in Data Science. 

I'm involved in Lafayette's Women in Computing Club, Kovalevsky Society (Women in Math), International Student Association, and I serve as the Data Manager for Lafayette's Data Community. As part of the EXCEL Scholars program at Lafayette College, I am working as a research assistant, contributing to scholarly economic research. My responsibilities include data wrangling, data visualization, and conducting statistical analyses, such as running regressions, and working with panel data and complex longitudinal datasets, as well as, conducting literature review.

I am proficient in programming languages such as Python, R, MySQL, Java, and HTML, and skilled in statistical software such as Stata. Outside of my busy schedule, I enjoy playing the piano, cooking, running, volunteering, and capturing beautiful sunset moments through photography.

In addition to my technical skills, I am the Director of Finance of the Cambodian Student Association in the United States [CSAUSA](https://www.csainusa.com/). I regularly attend conferences for women in STEM fields, such as the Grace Hopper Conference. I am also passionate about community building, leadership, and women empowerment.

I am constantly on the lookout for internship opportunities as a research assistant and data science or economics consulting for the upcoming Summer 2025. If you come across any leads or suggestions, I would very much appreciate it.
