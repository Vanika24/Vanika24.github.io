I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at [Lafayette College](https://economics.lafayette.edu/people/sayorn-chin/). I also hold the position of Data Science Fellow Affiliate at [Mountain Data Group](https://www.mountaindatagroup.com/). I completed my Ph.D. in Economics at Colorado State University in 2023. I earned a Master’s degree in Economics at Colorado State University in 2019 and Bachelor’s degree in Mathematical Economics at Colorado College in 2017.  

My primary research interests are in health and public economics, with a particular focus on income distribution and its impact on health. I explore the economics of inequality in the context of health and demographic differences, addressing policy-relevant questions by applying a diverse set of machine learning techniques and econometric methods, such as dynamic panel data estimators, natural experiments, and microsimulations. Although my work is grounded in sound underlying theory, I maintain a strong empirical focus, relying on data-driven approaches. I have had the opportunity to publish my research in popular journals, including the *Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization*.

When I am not working, you can find me watching [English Premier League](https://www.premierleague.com/) games on the weekend, working out, playing soccer, biking, or playing guitar and piano. I am an avid fan of jazz, blues, and [Liverpool FC](https://www.liverpoolfc.com/).
