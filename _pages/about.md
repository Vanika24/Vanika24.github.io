I am a rising junior at [Lafayette College](https://www.lafayette.edu/) pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics and Economics with a minor in Data Science. 

I'm actively involved in Lafayette's Women in Computing Club and serve as the Data Manager for Lafayette's Data Community. As part of the EXCEL Scholars program at Lafayette College, I worked as a research assistant, contributing to scholarly economic research. My responsibilities included data wrangling, data visualization, and conducting statistical analyses like running regressions, including working with panel data. 

I am proficient in programming languages such as Python, R, MySQL, Java, and HTML, as well as skilled in statistical software such as Stata. Outside of my busy schedule, I enjoy playing the piano, cooking, running, and capturing beautiful sunset moments through photography.

I am constantly on the lookout for internship opportunities as a research assistant and data science. If you come across any leads or suggestions, feel free to share!
