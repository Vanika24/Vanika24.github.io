The Welfare Cost of Late-life Depression (joint with Ray Miller and Ashish Kumar Sedai), *Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization* 204 (2022), 15–36. [Published Version](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167268122003523){: .btn--research} [WP](/files/pdf/research/Welfare_Cost_Late-life_Depression.pdf){: .btn--research}

> We quantify the welfare cost of depression among older Americans by estimating a panel VAR model of mental and physical health, labor supply, and consumption using data from the Health and Retirement Study. We use the estimated model and age sixty joint distribution of outcomes to simulate life-cycle paths with and without prevalence of depressive symptoms after age sixty. We estimate that the prevalence of late-life depressive symptoms costs an average of between 0.85 and 2.1 years in quality-adjusted life expectancy per person. Moreover, depression may result in an average loss of labor supply of up to 1.1 months and lifetime consumption of up to 16,000 US dollars. Combining into a single compensating variation welfare metric, we estimate a bound on the average welfare cost of depression of 8–15 percent of annual consumption after age sixty. On aggregate, this amounts to roughly 180–360 billion US dollars annually. We also project that while the average welfare cost of late-life depression is declining slightly over birth cohorts, the welfare burden is becoming significantly more unequal.

Beyond Income: Health, Wealth, and Racial/Ethnic Welfare Gaps Among Older Americans (joint with Ray Miller) [PDF](/files/pdf/research/Racial_Welfare_Chin_Miller_2023.pdf){: .btn--research} [Appendix](/files/pdf/research/Race_Online_Appendix.pdf){: .btn--research}

> We estimate racial and ethnic disparities in well-being among the older U.S. population using an expected utility framework that incorporates differences in consumption, leisure, health, mortality, and wealth. We use longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) supplemented with data from the Consumption and Activities Mail Survey (CAMS). Together, these provide a long and rich panel (1992-2016) for our analysis. Our measure broadly indicates that racial and ethnic inequality is larger than suggested by other welfare metrics such as income or consumption. We also find health, mortality, and wealth gaps are important in explaining the level of racial and ethnic welfare inequality among the older Americans in our sample, with leisure playing a comparatively minor role. Our decomposition exercises show that a majority of the estimated welfare gaps are determined by age sixty initial conditions as opposed to racial and ethnic differences in dynamic processes after age sixty. Our morbidity counterfactuals further suggest that eliminating common heath risk factors such as hypertension or diabetes in late-life only marginally closes overall welfare gaps. These simulations suggest that policies aimed at closing racial and ethnic gaps in late-life may be more successful and efficient if targeted earlier in the life-cycle. In other words, outside of direct wealth transfers, it may largely be too late to target such interventions directly at older populations.

The Compensation of Conscience: Evidence from the U.S. Labor Market (joint with Sammy Zahran, Ray Miller and Anders Fremstad) [PDF](/files/pdf/research/Moral_Values_2023.pdf){: .btn--research}

> We investigate compensating differentials in the U.S. labor market related to the degree of moral compromise required in different occupations. Specifically, we explore whether jobs that require workers to compromise their moral values offer higher compensation to compensate for the disamenities that contradict their moral beliefs. To conduct our analysis, we utilize data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97) and supplement it with data from the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) job descriptor, which allows us to develop a continuous measure of moral index across occupations. This data provides a rich and extensive panel spanning from 1997 to 2017 for our analysis. Our findings, obtained through the use of two-ways fixed-effects and first-difference models, indicate that jobs that require workers to compromise their moral principles are associated with higher compensation. This suggests that there is indeed a compensating differential for engaging in disamenities that conflict with a worker's moral values. Additionally, we observed that workers with a college education receive higher pay in jobs that require moral compromise, indicating that individuals with a college degree may have more employment opportunities and greater bargaining power, influencing their compensation preferences. Furthermore, we discovered evidence supporting an asymmetric relationship between changes in the occupational moral index and total hourly compensation. This relationship appears to be responsive to the intensity of moral compromise in the job.

Growing Old in Rural America: Measuring Late Life Health and Economic Well-being (joint with Ray Miller and Yuulin An)

> We estimate well-being among older rural Americans using an expected utility framework that incorporates differences in consumption, leisure, health, mortality, and wealth using data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). At age sixty, we estimate mean rural consumption expenditures of 24,404 US dollars, a retirement probability of 52 percent, and a remaining life expectancy of 20.5 years for the cohort born 1931-36. When adjusting life expectancy for living in poor health, we obtain an age sixty quality adjusted life expectancy (QALE) of only 15.7 years. Our combined welfare metric suggests well-being among rural residents is only 72 percent that of older urban residents—largely driven by substantial consumption and QALE gaps. Moreover, our measure broadly indicates that regional inequality is larger than suggested by other welfare metrics such as income or consumption alone. We also find that older rural Americans are generally falling further behind older urban American across birth cohorts. Most of this widening gap is also driven by declining relative consumption and QALE.
